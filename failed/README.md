# Package & Version Failures

This directory lists packages and package versions that are present in the `bower-packages.json` and `new-packages.json` files, but which could not be added to the new registry. Their package names have been reserved (no one can register any of the packages listed below).

Packages with failures that prevented us from processing any versions for them are listed in the `package-failures.json` file. For example, we can't process packages that no longer exist at their repo URL.

Package versions with errors are listed in the `version-failures.json` file.
