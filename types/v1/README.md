# Specs V1

The Dhall types in this directory represent core data types for the registry which the registry guarantees forwards compatibility for. Those include:

- `Manifest.dhall`: the `purs.json` manifest format
- `Metadata.dhall`: the package metadata file format

as well as other types required by these two file formats. To learn more, please see the [SPEC.md](../../SPEC.md).
