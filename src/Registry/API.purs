-- PacchettiBotti's keys are stored in base64-encoded strings in the

--
-- 1. Generate the keypair
-- $ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "pacchettibotti@purescript.org"
--
-- 2. Encode the keypair (run this for both public and private):
-- $ cat id_ed25519 | base64 | tr -d \\n
-- $ cat id_ed25519.pub | base64 | tr -d \\n
--
-- 3. Store the results in 1Password and in GitHub secrets storage.
