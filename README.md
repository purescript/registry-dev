# PureScript Registry Development

[![deploy](https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/purescript/registry-dev/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repository hosts the code for the PureScript Registry and its affiliated projects. If you are new to the registry and are interested in its development, then the following should be helpful:

- The [specification](./SPEC.md) describes what the registry is, how it works, and its fundamental types and operations.
- The [contributor guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) describes how to get started working on the registry repository.

If you are interested in the products of the registry, then you should see:

- The [registry](https://github.com/purescript/registry) and [registry-index](https://github.com/purescript/registry-index) repositories host metadata about packages and is the main user-facing part of the registry.
- The [registry server](https://registry.purescript.org) hosts the registry API for publishing packages.
- The [registry storage backend](https://packages.registry.purescript.org) hosts package tarballs so they can be downloaded by package managers.

Package documentation is [hosted on Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org).
