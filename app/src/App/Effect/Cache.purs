-- | A generic, extensible, typed cache effect suitable for retaining data that
-- | is slow or expensive to compute. Multiple caches can be created so long as
-- | they use different keys, and caches can be interpreted with different
-- | strategies, such as in-memory only, or backed by the file system, or by a
-- | database like SQLite.
-- |
-- | A typed cache is more complicated than an untyped one, but it has two
-- | significant benefits: first, you know what type you will receive when
-- | reading from the cache, and second, you can store types directly to
-- | in-memory caches, without the overhead of serialization and deserialization.
